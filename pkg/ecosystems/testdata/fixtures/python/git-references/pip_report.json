By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.8+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to\n[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look at:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,\nQuora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):\n\n> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nand [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code.

It moved to its own file.\n\nSee [CHANGES](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.html).\n\n## Authors\n\nThe author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.\n\nSee [AUTHORS.md](./AUTHORS.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,\npull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect\nand more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the\n[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).\n\nAt the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's\nFlying Circus is expected. We are not savages.\n\nAnd if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.\n# Change Log\n\n## 23.12.1\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Fixed a bug that included dependencies from the `d` extra by default (#4108)\n\n## 23.12.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nIt's almost 2024, which means it's time for a new edition of _Black_'s stable style!\nTogether with this release, we'll put out an alpha release 24.1a1 showcasing the draft\n2024 stable style, which we'll finalize in the January release. Please try it out and\n[share your feedback](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4042).\n\nThis release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style. Most but not all of the\nchanges in `--preview` mode will be in the 2024 stable style.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix bug where `# fmt: off` automatically dedents when used with the `--line-ranges`\n  option, even when it is not within the specified line range. (#4084)\n- Fix feature detection for parenthesized context managers (#4104)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Prefer more equal signs before a break when splitting chained assignments (#4010)\n- Standalone form feed characters at the module level are no longer removed (#4021)\n- Additional cases of immediately nested tuples, lists, and dictionaries are now\n  indented less (#4012)\n- Allow empty lines at the beginning of all blocks, except immediately before a\n  docstring (#4060)\n- Fix crash in preview mode when using a short `--line-length` (#4086)\n- Keep suites consisting of only an ellipsis on their own lines if they are not\n  functions or class definitions (#4066) (#4103)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `--line-ranges` now skips _Black_'s internal stability check in `--safe` mode. This\n  avoids a crash on rare inputs that have many unformatted same-content lines. (#4034)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade to mypy 1.7.1 (#4049) (#4069)\n- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.12 (#4070)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Enable 3.12 CI (#4035)\n- Build docker images in parallel (#4054)\n- Build docker images with 3.12 (#4055)\n\n## 23.11.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Support formatting ranges of lines with the new `--line-ranges` command-line option\n  (#4020)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix crash on formatting bytes strings that look like docstrings (#4003)\n- Fix crash when whitespace followed a backslash before newline in a docstring (#4008)\n- Fix standalone comments inside complex blocks crashing Black (#4016)\n- Fix crash on formatting code like `await (a ** b)` (#3994)\n- No longer treat leading f-strings as docstrings. This matches Python's behaviour and\n  fixes a crash (#4019)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Multiline dicts and lists that are the sole argument to a function are now indented\n  less (#3964)\n- Multiline unpacked dicts and lists as the sole argument to a function are now also\n  indented less (#3992)\n- In f-string debug expressions, quote types that are visible in the final string are\n  now preserved (#4005)\n- Fix a bug where long `case` blocks were not split into multiple lines. Also enable\n  general trailing comma rules on `case` blocks (#4024)\n- Keep requiring two empty lines between module-level docstring and first function or\n  class definition (#4028)\n- Add support for single-line format skip with other comments on the same line (#3959)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Consistently apply force exclusion logic before resolving symlinks (#4015)\n- Fix a bug in the matching of absolute path names in `--include` (#3976)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Fix mypyc builds on arm64 on macOS (#4017)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black's pre-commit integration will now run only on git hooks appropriate for a code\n  formatter (#3940)\n\n## 23.10.1\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Maintenance release to get a fix out for GitHub Action edge case (#3957)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Fix merging implicit multiline strings that have inline comments (#3956)\n- Allow empty first line after block open before a comment or compound statement (#3967)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Change Dockerfile to hatch + compile black (#3965)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- The summary output for GitHub workflows is now suppressible using the `summary`\n  parameter. (#3958)\n- Fix the action failing when Black check doesn't pass (#3957)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- It is known Windows documentation CI is broken\n  https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3968\n\n## 23.10.0\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix comments getting removed from inside parenthesized strings (#3909)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Fix long lines with power operators getting split before the line length (#3942)\n- Long type hints are now wrapped in parentheses and properly indented when split across\n  multiple lines (#3899)\n- Magic trailing commas are now respected in return types. (#3916)\n- Require one empty line after module-level docstrings. (#3932)\n- Treat raw triple-quoted strings as docstrings (#3947)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Fix cache versioning logic when `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` is set (#3937)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Fix bug where attributes named `type` were not accepted inside `match` statements\n  (#3950)\n- Add support for PEP 695 type aliases containing lambdas and other unusual expressions\n  (#3949)\n\n### Output\n\n- Black no longer attempts to provide special errors for attempting to format Python 2\n  code (#3933)\n- Black will more consistently print stacktraces on internal errors in verbose mode\n  (#3938)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- The action output displayed in the job summary is now wrapped in Markdown (#3914)\n\n## 23.9.1\n\nDue to various issues, the previous release (23.9.0) did not include compiled mypyc\nwheels, which make Black significantly faster. These issues have now been fixed, and\nthis release should come with compiled wheels once again.\n\nThere will be no wheels for Python 3.12 due to a bug in mypyc. We will provide 3.12\nwheels in a future release as soon as the mypyc bug is fixed.\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade to mypy 1.5.1 (#3864)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Store raw tuples instead of NamedTuples in Black's cache, improving performance and\n  decreasing the size of the cache (#3877)\n\n## 23.9.0\n\n### Preview style\n\n- More concise formatting for dummy implementations (#3796)\n- In stub files, add a blank line between a statement with a body (e.g an\n  `if sys.version_info > (3, x):`) and a function definition on the same level (#3862)\n- Fix a bug whereby spaces were removed from walrus operators within subscript(#3823)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Black now applies exclusion and ignore logic before resolving symlinks (#3846)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Avoid importing `IPython` if notebook cells do not contain magics (#3782)\n- Improve caching by comparing file hashes as fallback for mtime and size (#3821)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Fix an issue in `blackd` with single character input (#3558)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black now has an\n  [official pre-commit mirror](https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror). Swapping\n  `https://github.com/psf/black` to `https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror` in\n  your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will make Black about 2x faster (#3828)\n- The `.black.env` folder specified by `ENV_PATH` will now be removed on the completion\n  of the GitHub Action (#3759)\n\n## 23.7.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Runtime support for Python 3.7 has been removed. Formatting 3.7 code will still be\n  supported until further notice (#3765)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix a bug where an illegal trailing comma was added to return type annotations using\n  PEP 604 unions (#3735)\n- Fix several bugs and crashes where comments in stub files were removed or mishandled\n  under some circumstances (#3745)\n- Fix a crash with multi-line magic comments like `type: ignore` within parentheses\n  (#3740)\n- Fix error in AST validation when _Black_ removes trailing whitespace in a type comment\n  (#3773)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are no longer wrapped inside\n  parentheses (#3640)\n- Remove blank lines between a class definition and its docstring (#3692)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- The `--workers` argument to _Black_ can now be specified via the `BLACK_NUM_WORKERS`\n  environment variable (#3743)\n- `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache` and `.vscode` are now excluded by default (#3691)\n- Fix _Black_ not honouring `pyproject.toml` settings when running `--stdin-filename`\n  and the `pyproject.toml` found isn't in the current working directory (#3719)\n- _Black_ will now error if `exclude` and `extend-exclude` have invalid data types in\n  `pyproject.toml`, instead of silently doing the wrong thing (#3764)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade mypyc from 0.991 to 1.3 (#3697)\n- Remove patching of Click that mitigated errors on Python 3.6 with `LANG=C` (#3768)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Add support for the new PEP 695 syntax in Python 3.12 (#3703)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Speed up _Black_ significantly when the cache is full (#3751)\n- Avoid importing `IPython` in a case where we wouldn't need it (#3748)\n\n### Output\n\n- Use aware UTC datetimes internally, avoids deprecation warning on Python 3.12 (#3728)\n- Change verbose logging to exactly mirror _Black_'s logic for source discovery (#3749)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- The `blackd` argument parser now shows the default values for options in their help\n  text (#3712)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black is now tested with\n  [`PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING = 1`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io-encoding-warning)\n  (#3763)\n- Update GitHub Action to display black output in the job summary (#3688)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Add a CITATION.cff file to the root of the repository, containing metadata on how to\n  cite this software (#3723)\n- Update the _classes_ and _exceptions_ documentation in Developer reference to match\n  the latest code base (#3755)\n\n## 23.3.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis release fixes a longstanding confusing behavior in Black's GitHub action, where the\nversion of the action did not determine the version of Black being run (issue #3382). In\naddition, there is a small bug fix around imports and a number of improvements to the\npreview style.\n\nPlease try out the\n[preview style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html#preview-style)\nwith `black --preview` and tell us your feedback. All changes in the preview style are\nexpected to become part of Black's stable style in January 2024.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Import lines with `# fmt: skip` and `# fmt: off` no longer have an extra blank line\n  added when they are right after another import line (#3610)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last\n  entry (#3393)\n- `async def`, `async for`, and `async with` statements are now formatted consistently\n  compared to their non-async version. (#3609)\n- `with` statements that contain two context managers will be consistently wrapped in\n  parentheses (#3589)\n- Let string splitters respect [East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)\n  (#3445)\n- Now long string literals can be split after East Asian commas and periods (`、` U+3001\n  IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA, `。` U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP, & `，` U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA)\n  besides before spaces (#3445)\n- For stubs, enforce one blank line after a nested class with a body other than just\n  `...` (#3564)\n- Improve handling of multiline strings by changing line split behavior (#1879)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Added support for formatting files with invalid type comments (#3594)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Update GitHub Action to use the version of Black equivalent to action's version if\n  version input is not specified (#3543)\n- Fix missing Python binary path in autoload script for vim (#3508)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Document that only the most recent release is supported for security issues;\n  vulnerabilities should be reported through Tidelift (#3612)\n\n## 23.1.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis is the first release of 2023, and following our\n[stability policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy),\nit comes with a number of improvements to our stable style, including improvements to\nempty line handling, removal of redundant parentheses in several contexts, and output\nthat highlights implicitly concatenated strings better.\n\nThere are also many changes to the preview style; try out `black --preview` and give us\nfeedback to help us set the stable style for next year.\n\nIn addition to style changes, Black now automatically infers the supported Python\nversions from your `pyproject.toml` file, removing the need to set Black's target\nversions separately.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Introduce the 2023 stable style, which incorporates most aspects of last year's\n  preview style (#3418). Specific changes:\n  - Enforce empty lines before classes and functions with sticky leading comments\n    (#3302) (22.12.0)\n  - Reformat empty and whitespace-only files as either an empty file (if no newline is\n    present) or as a single newline character (if a newline is present) (#3348)\n    (22.12.0)\n  - Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are now wrapped inside\n    parentheses (#3307) (22.12.0)\n  - Correctly handle trailing commas that are inside a line's leading non-nested parens\n    (#3370) (22.12.0)\n  - `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being\n    normalized as expected (#3168) (since 22.8.0)\n  - When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n    subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209) (22.8.0)\n  - Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside\n    parentheses (#3162) (22.8.0)\n  - Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of\n    implicitly concatenated strings on its own line (#3227) (22.8.0)\n  - Docstring quotes are no longer moved if it would violate the line length limit\n    (#3044, #3430) (22.6.0)\n  - Parentheses around return annotations are now managed (#2990) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses around awaited objects (#2991) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses in `with` statements (#2926) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove trailing newlines after code block open (#3035) (22.6.0)\n  - Code cell separators `#%%` are now standardised to `# %%` (#2919) (22.3.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses from `except` statements (#2939) (22.3.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses from tuple unpacking in `for` loops (#2945) (22.3.0)\n  - Avoid magic-trailing-comma in single-element subscripts (#2942) (22.3.0)\n- Fix a crash when a colon line is marked between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` (#3439)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Format hex codes in unicode escape sequences in string literals (#2916)\n- Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions (#2278)\n- Improve performance on large expressions that contain many strings (#3467)\n- Fix a crash in preview style with assert + parenthesized string (#3415)\n- Fix crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in function return annotations\n  and except clauses (#3423)\n- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where mixed implicitly concatenated\n  regular and f-strings start with an empty span (#3463)\n- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where a standalone comment is placed\n  before a dict's value (#3469)\n- Fix an issue where extra empty lines are added when a decorator has `# fmt: skip`\n  applied or there is a standalone comment between decorators (#3470)\n- Do not put the closing quotes in a docstring on a separate line, even if the line is\n  too long (#3430)\n- Long values in dict literals are now wrapped in parentheses; correspondingly\n  unnecessary parentheses around short values in dict literals are now removed; long\n  string lambda values are now wrapped in parentheses (#3440)\n- Fix two crashes in preview style involving edge cases with docstrings (#3451)\n- Exclude string type annotations from improved string processing; fix crash when the\n  return type annotation is stringified and spans across multiple lines (#3462)\n- Wrap multiple context managers in parentheses when targeting Python 3.9+ (#3489)\n- Fix several crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in `with` statements\n  or tuples (#3473)\n- Fix an invalid quote escaping bug in f-string expressions where it produced invalid\n  code.

Native x86-64 executables for macOS are available once again.\n  (#3275)\n- Hatchling is now used as the build backend. This will not have any effect for users\n  who install Black with its wheels from PyPI. (#3233)\n- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.11 (#3276)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Windows style (CRLF) newlines will be preserved (#3257).\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Vim plugin: add flag (`g:black_preview`) to enable/disable the preview style (#3246)\n- Update GitHub Action to support formatting of Jupyter Notebook files via a `jupyter`\n  option (#3282)\n- Update GitHub Action to support use of version specifiers (e.g. `<23`) for Black\n  version (#3265)\n\n## 22.8.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Python 3.11 is now supported, except for _blackd_ as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as\n  of publishing (#3234)\n- This is the last release that supports running _Black_ on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6\n  code will continue to be supported until further notice)\n- Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that\n  affect code that was not previously formatted by _Black_ (#3155)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix an infinite loop when using `# fmt: on/off` in the middle of an expression or code\n  block (#3158)\n- Fix incorrect handling of `# fmt: skip` on colon (`:`) lines (#3148)\n- Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators\n  (#2874)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as\n  this is invalid.

There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!\n\nRequests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`— according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.\n\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)\n[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests)\n[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/psf/requests.svg)](https://github.com/psf/requests/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Installing Requests and Supported Versions\n\nRequests is available on PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip install requests\n```\n\nRequests officially supports Python 3.7+.\n\n## Supported Features & Best–Practices\n\nRequests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP–speaking applications, for the needs of today.\n\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification\n- Basic & Digest Authentication\n- Familiar `dict`–like Cookies\n- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding\n- Multi-part File Uploads\n- SOCKS Proxy Support\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Streaming Downloads\n- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`\n- Chunked HTTP Requests\n\n## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n[![Read the Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/ss.png)](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nWhen cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c\nfetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see\n[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):\n\n```shell\ngit clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git\n```\n\nYou can also apply this setting to your global Git config:\n\n```shell\ngit config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore\n```\n\n---\n\n[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org) [![Python Software Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/psf.png)](https://www.python.org/psf)\n\n\n"

Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (e.g. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can.\n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair Unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess (aka. defining noise in rendered text).\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

        "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for `Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_\nand `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThe latest versions of these standards supplied here provide\nmore comprehensive language coverage and reduce the potential of\nallowing domains with known security vulnerabilities. This library\nis a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports an older superseded IDNA specification from 2003.\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI via the\ntypical mechanisms, such as:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to ASCII compatible encoding\n(known as A-labels), or to Unicode strings (known as U-labels)\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis library provides support for `Unicode IDNA Compatibility\nProcessing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_ which normalizes input from\ndifferent potential ways a user may input a domain prior to performing the IDNA\nconversion operations. This functionality, known as a \n`mapping <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, is considered by the\nspecification to be a local user-interface issue distinct from IDNA\nconversion functionality.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its position in the string (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards using the command-line\nscript ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.8 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Support for older versions are likely to be removed from new releases\n  as automated tests can no longer easily be run, i.e. once the Python\n  version is officially end-of-life.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n* **Transitional processing**. Unicode 16.0.0 removed transitional\n  processing so the `transitional` argument for the encode() method\n  no longer has any effect and will be removed at a later date.\n\n"

        "description": "\nPathSpec\n========\n\n*pathspec* is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths. So\nfar this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching which itself is\nderived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses wildmatch for its `gitignore`_\nfiles.\n\n.. _`gitignore`: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\n\n\nTutorial\n--------\n\nSay you have a \"Projects\" directory and you want to back it up, but only\ncertain files, and ignore others depending on certain conditions::\n\n\t>>> import pathspec\n\t>>> # The gitignore-style patterns for files to select, but we're including\n\t>>> # instead of ignoring.\n\t>>> spec_text = \"\"\"\n\t...\n\t... # This is a comment because the line begins with a hash: \"#\"\n\t...\n\t... # Include several project directories (and all descendants) relative to\n\t... # the current directory. To reference a directory you must end with a\n\t... # slash: \"/\"\n\t... /project-a/\n\t... /project-b/\n\t... /project-c/\n\t...\n\t... # Patterns can be negated by prefixing with exclamation mark: \"!\"\n\t...\n\t... # Ignore temporary files beginning or ending with \"~\" and ending with\n\t... # \".swp\".\n\t... !~*\n\t... !*~\n\t... !*.swp\n\t...\n\t... # These are python projects so ignore compiled python files from\n\t... # testing.\n\t... !*.pyc\n\t...\n\t... # Ignore the build directories but only directly under the project\n\t... # directories.\n\t... !/*/build/\n\t...\n\t... \"\"\"\n\nWe want to use the ``GitWildMatchPattern`` class to compile our patterns. The\n``PathSpec`` class provides an interface around pattern implementations::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())\n\nThat may be a mouthful but it allows for additional patterns to be implemented\nin the future without them having to deal with anything but matching the paths\nsent to them. ``GitWildMatchPattern`` is the implementation of the actual\npattern which internally gets converted into a regular expression. ``PathSpec``\nis a simple wrapper around a list of compiled patterns.\n\nTo make things simpler, we can use the registered name for a pattern class\ninstead of always having to provide a reference to the class itself. The\n``GitWildMatchPattern`` class is registered as **gitwildmatch**::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', spec_text.splitlines())\n\nIf we wanted to manually compile the patterns we can just do the following::\n\n\t>>> patterns = map(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())\n\t>>> spec = PathSpec(patterns)\n\n``PathSpec.from_lines()`` is simply a class method which does just that.\n\nIf you want to load the patterns from file, you can pass the file instance\ndirectly as well::\n\n\t>>> with open('patterns.list', 'r') as fh:\n\t>>>     spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', fh)\n\nYou can perform matching on a whole directory tree with::\n\n\t>>> matches = spec.match_tree('path/to/directory')\n\nOr you can perform matching on a specific set of file paths with::\n\n\t>>> matches = spec.match_files(file_paths)\n\nOr check to see if an individual file matches::\n\n\t>>> is_matched = spec.match_file(file_path)\n\nThere is a specialized class, ``pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec``, which more closely\nimplements the behavior of **gitignore**. This uses ``GitWildMatchPattern``\npattern by default and handles some edge cases differently from the generic\n``PathSpec`` class. ``GitIgnoreSpec`` can be used without specifying the pattern\nfactory::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec.from_lines(spec_text.splitlines())\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n*pathspec* is licensed under the `Mozilla Public License Version 2.0`_. See\n`LICENSE`_ or the `FAQ`_ for more information.\n\nIn summary, you may use *pathspec* with any closed or open source project\nwithout affecting the license of the larger work so long as you:\n\n- give credit where credit is due,\n\n- and release any custom changes made to *pathspec*.\n\n.. _`Mozilla Public License Version 2.0`: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0\n.. _`LICENSE`: LICENSE\n.. _`FAQ`: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html\n\n\nSource\n------\n\nThe source code for *pathspec* is available from the GitHub repo\n`cpburnz/python-pathspec`_.\n\n.. _`cpburnz/python-pathspec`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n*pathspec* is available for install through `PyPI`_::\n\n\tpip install pathspec\n\n*pathspec* can also be built from source. The following packages will be\nrequired:\n\n- `build`_ (>=0.6.0)\n\n*pathspec* can then be built and installed with::\n\n\tpython -m build\n\tpip install dist/pathspec-*-py3-none-any.whl\n\n.. _`PyPI`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathspec\n.. _`build`: https://pypi.org/project/build/\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation for *pathspec* is available on `Read the Docs`_.\n\n.. _`Read the Docs`: https://python-path-specification.readthedocs.io\n\n\nOther Languages\n---------------\n\nThe related project `pathspec-ruby`_ (by *highb*) provides a similar library as\na `Ruby gem`_.\n\n.. _`pathspec-ruby`: https://github.com/highb/pathspec-ruby\n.. _`Ruby gem`: https://rubygems.org/gems/pathspec\n\n\n\nChange History\n==============\n\n\n0.12.1 (2023-12-10)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #84`_: PathSpec.match_file() returns None since 0.12.0.\n\n\n.. _`Issue #84`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/84\n\n\n0.12.0 (2023-12-09)\n-------------------\n\nMajor changes:\n\n- Dropped support of EOL Python 3.7. See `Pull #82`_.\n\n\nAPI changes:\n\n- Signature of protected method `pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec._match_file()` (with a leading underscore) has been changed from `def _match_file(patterns: Iterable[Pattern], file: str) -> bool` to `def _match_file(patterns: Iterable[Tuple[int, Pattern]], file: str) -> Tuple[Optional[bool], Optional[int]]`.\n\nNew features:\n\n- Added `pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec.check_*()` methods. These methods behave similarly to `.match_*()` but return additional information in the `pathspec.util.CheckResult` objects (e.g., `CheckResult.index` indicates the index of the last pattern that matched the file).\n- Added `pathspec.pattern.RegexPattern.pattern` attribute which stores the original, uncompiled pattern.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #81`_: GitIgnoreSpec behaviors differ from git.\n- `Pull #83`_: Fix ReadTheDocs builds.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Mark Python 3.12 as supported. See `Pull #82`_.\n- Improve test debugging.\n- Improve type hint on *on_error* parameter on `pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec.match_tree_entries()`.\n- Improve type hint on *on_error* parameter on `pathspec.util.iter_tree_entries()`.\n\n\n.. _`Issue #81`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/81\n.. _`Pull #82`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/82\n.. _`Pull #83`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/83\n\n\n0.11.2 (2023-07-28)\n-------------------\n\nNew features:\n\n- `Issue #80`_: match_files with negated path spec. `pathspec.PathSpec.match_*()` now have a `negate` parameter to make using *.gitignore* logic easier and more efficient.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Pull #76`_: Add edge case: patterns that end with an escaped space\n- `Issue #77`_/`Pull #78`_: Negate with caret symbol as with the exclamation mark.\n\n\n.. _`Pull #76`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/76\n.. _`Issue #77`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/77\n.. _`Pull #78`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/78/\n.. _`Issue #80`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/80\n\n\n0.11.1 (2023-03-14)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #74`_: Include directory should override exclude file.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- `Pull #75`_: Fix partially unknown PathLike type.\n- Convert `os.PathLike` to a string properly using `os.fspath`.\n\n\n.. _`Issue #74`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/74\n.. _`Pull #75`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/75\n\n\n0.11.0 (2023-01-24)\n-------------------\n\nMajor changes:\n\n- Changed build backend to `flit_core.buildapi`_ from `setuptools.build_meta`_. Building with `setuptools` through `setup.py` is still supported for distributions that need it. See `Issue #72`_.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- `Issue #72`_/`Pull #73`_: Please consider switching the build-system to flit_core to ease setuptools bootstrap.\n\n\n.. _`flit_core.buildapi`: https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html\n.. _`Issue #72`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/72\n.. _`Pull #73`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/73\n\n\n0.10.3 (2022-12-09)\n-------------------\n\nNew features:\n\n- Added utility function `pathspec.util.append_dir_sep()` to aid in distinguishing between directories and files on the file-system.

See `Issue #47`_.\n- The *gitwildmatch* pattern `dir/*` is now handled the same as `dir/`. This means `dir/*` will now match all descendants rather than only direct children. See `Issue #19`_.\n- Added `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec` class (see new features).\n- Changed build system to `pyproject.toml`_ and build backend to `setuptools.build_meta`_ which may have unforeseen consequences.\n- Renamed GitHub project from `python-path-specification`_ to `python-pathspec`_. See `Issue #35`_.\n\nAPI changes:\n\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.normalize_files()` is no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.\n-\tDeprecated: `pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match()` is no longer used. Use or implement\n\t`pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match_file()`.\n\nNew features:\n\n- Added class `pathspec.gitignore.GitIgnoreSpec` (with alias `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec`) to implement *gitignore* behavior not possible with standard `PathSpec` class. The particular *gitignore* behavior implemented is prioritizing patterns matching the file directly over matching an ancestor directory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #19`_: Files inside an ignored sub-directory are not matched.\n- `Issue #41`_: Incorrectly (?) matches files inside directories that do match.\n- `Pull #51`_: Refactor deprecated unittest aliases for Python 3.11 compatibility.\n- `Issue #53`_: Symlink pathspec_meta.py breaks Windows.\n- `Issue #54`_: test_util.py uses os.symlink which can fail on Windows.\n- `Issue #55`_: Backslashes at start of pattern not handled correctly.\n- `Pull #56`_: pyproject.toml: include subpackages in setuptools config\n- `Issue #57`_: `!` doesn't exclude files in directories if the pattern doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Support Python 3.10, 3.11.\n- Modernize code to Python 3.7.\n- `Issue #52`_: match_files() is not a pure generator function, and it impacts tree_*() gravely.\n\n\n.. _`python-path-specification`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-path-specification\n.. _`python-pathspec`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec\n.. _`pyproject.toml`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/\n.. _`setuptools.build_meta`: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html\n.. _`Issue #19`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/19\n.. _`Issue #35`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/35\n.. _`Issue #41`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/41\n.. _`Issue #47`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/47\n.. _`Pull #51`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/51\n.. _`Issue #52`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/52\n.. _`Issue #53`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/53\n.. _`Issue #54`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/54\n.. _`Issue #55`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/55\n.. _`Pull #56`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/56\n.. _`Issue #57`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/57\n\n\n0.9.0 (2021-07-17)\n------------------\n\n- `Issue #44`_/`Pull #50`_: Raise `GitWildMatchPatternError` for invalid git patterns.\n- `Pull #45`_: Fix for duplicate leading double-asterisk, and edge cases.\n- `Issue #46`_: Fix matching absolute paths.\n- API change: `util.normalize_files()` now returns a `Dict[str, List[pathlike]]` instead of a `Dict[str, pathlike]`.\n- Added type hinting.\n\n.. _`Issue #44`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/44\n.. _`Pull #45`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/45\n.. _`Issue #46`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/46\n.. _`Pull #50`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/50\n\n\n0.8.1 (2020-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- `Pull #43`_: Add support for addition operator.\n\n.. _`Pull #43`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/43\n\n\n0.8.0 (2020-04-09)\n------------------\n\n- `Issue #30`_: Expose what patterns matched paths.

Even for single-platform apps, there\nmay by plenty of nuances in figuring out the right location.\n\nFor example, if running on macOS, you should use::\n\n    ~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>\n\nIf on Windows (at least English Win) that should be::\n\n    C:\\Users\\<User>\\Application Data\\Local Settings\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\n\nor possibly::\n\n    C:\\Users\\<User>\\Application Data\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\n\nfor `roaming profiles <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-vista/cc766489(v=ws.10)>`_ but that is another story.\n\nOn Linux (and other Unices), according to the `XDG Basedir Spec`_, it should be::\n\n    ~/.local/share/<AppName>\n\n.. _XDG Basedir Spec: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\n\n``platformdirs`` to the rescue\n==============================\n\nThis kind of thing is what the ``platformdirs`` package is for.\n``platformdirs`` will help you choose an appropriate:\n\n- user data dir (``user_data_dir``)\n- user config dir (``user_config_dir``)\n- user cache dir (``user_cache_dir``)\n- site data dir (``site_data_dir``)\n- site config dir (``site_config_dir``)\n- user log dir (``user_log_dir``)\n- user documents dir (``user_documents_dir``)\n- user downloads dir (``user_downloads_dir``)\n- user pictures dir (``user_pictures_dir``)\n- user videos dir (``user_videos_dir``)\n- user music dir (``user_music_dir``)\n- user desktop dir (``user_desktop_dir``)\n- user runtime dir (``user_runtime_dir``)\n\nAnd also:\n\n- Is slightly opinionated on the directory names used. Look for \"OPINION\" in\n  documentation and code for when an opinion is being applied.\n\nExample output\n==============\n\nOn macOS:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from platformdirs import *\n    >>> appname = \"SuperApp\"\n    >>> appauthor = \"Acme\"\n    >>> user_data_dir(appname, appauthor)\n    '/Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/SuperApp'\n    >>> user_config_dir(appname,

[TOML](https://toml.io).\nIt is fully compatible with [TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).\n\nA version of Tomli, the `tomllib` module,\nwas added to the standard library in Python 3.11\nvia [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/).\nTomli continues to provide a backport on PyPI for Python versions\nwhere the standard library module is not available\nand that have not yet reached their end-of-life.\n\nTomli uses [mypyc](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc)\nto generate binary wheels for most of the widely used platforms,\nso Python 3.11+ users may prefer it over `tomllib` for improved performance.\nPure Python wheels are available on any platform and should perform the same as `tomllib`.\n\n## Installation<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n\n```bash\npip install tomli\n```\n\n## Usage<a name=\"usage\"></a>\n\n### Parse a TOML string<a name=\"parse-a-toml-string\"></a>\n\n```python\nimport tomli\n\ntoml_str = \"\"\"\n[[players]]\nname = \"Lehtinen\"\nnumber = 26\n\n[[players]]\nname = \"Numminen\"\nnumber = 27\n\"\"\"\n\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(toml_str)\nassert toml_dict == {\n    \"players\": [{\"name\": \"Lehtinen\", \"number\": 26}, {\"name\": \"Numminen\", \"number\": 27}]\n}\n```\n\n### Parse a TOML file<a name=\"parse-a-toml-file\"></a>\n\n```python\nimport tomli\n\nwith open(\"path_to_file/conf.toml\", \"rb\") as f:\n    toml_dict = tomli.load(f)\n```\n\nThe file must be opened in binary mode (with the `\"rb\"` flag).\nBinary mode will enforce decoding the file as UTF-8 with universal newlines disabled,\nboth of which are required to correctly parse TOML.\n\n### Handle invalid TOML<a name=\"handle-invalid-toml\"></a>\n\n```python\nimport tomli\n\ntry:\n    toml_dict = tomli.loads(\"]] this is invalid TOML [[\")\nexcept tomli.TOMLDecodeError:\n    print(\"Yep, definitely not valid.\")\n```\n\nNote that error messages are considered informational only.\nThey should not be assumed to stay constant across Tomli versions.\n\n### Construct `decimal.Decimal`s from TOML floats<a name=\"construct-decimaldecimals-from-toml-floats\"></a>\n\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal\nimport tomli\n\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(\"precision-matters = 0.982492\", parse_float=Decimal)\nassert isinstance(toml_dict[\"precision-matters\"], Decimal)\nassert toml_dict[\"precision-matters\"] == Decimal(\"0.982492\")\n```\n\nNote that `decimal.Decimal` can be replaced with another callable that converts a TOML float from string to a Python type.\nThe `decimal.Decimal` is, however, a practical choice for use cases where float inaccuracies can not be tolerated.\n\nIllegal types are `dict` and `list`, and their subtypes.\nA `ValueError` will be raised if `parse_float` produces illegal types.\n\n### Building a `tomli`/`tomllib` compatibility layer<a name=\"building-a-tomlitomllib-compatibility-layer\"></a>\n\nPython versions 3.11+ ship with a version of Tomli:\nthe `tomllib` standard library module.\nTo build code that uses the standard library if available,\nbut still works seamlessly with Python 3.6+,\ndo the following.\n\nInstead of a hard Tomli dependency, use the following\n[dependency specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/)\nto only require Tomli when the standard library module is not available:\n\n```\ntomli >= 1.1.0 ; python_version < \"3.11\"\n```\n\nThen, in your code, import a TOML parser using the following fallback mechanism:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 11):\n    import tomllib\nelse:\n    import tomli as tomllib\n\ntomllib.loads(\"['This parses fine with Python 3.6+']\")\n```\n\n## FAQ<a name=\"faq\"></a>\n\n### Why this parser?<a name=\"why-this-parser\"></a>\n\n- it's lil'\n- pure Python with zero dependencies\n- the fastest pure Python parser [\\*](#pure-python):\n  18x as fast as [tomlkit](https://pypi.org/project/tomlkit/),\n  2.1x as fast as [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)\n- outputs [basic data types](#how-do-toml-types-map-into-python-types) only\n- 100% spec compliant: passes all tests in\n  [BurntSushi/toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)\n  test suite\n- thoroughly tested: 100% branch coverage\n\n### Is comment preserving round-trip parsing supported?<a name=\"is-comment-preserving-round-trip-parsing-supported\"></a>\n\nNo.\n\nThe `tomli.loads` function returns a plain `dict` that is populated with builtin types and types from the standard library only.\nPreserving comments requires a custom type to be returned so will not be supported,\nat least not by the `tomli.loads` and `tomli.load` functions.\n\nLook into [TOML Kit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit) if preservation of style is what you need.\n\n### Is there a `dumps`, `write` or `encode` function?<a name=\"is-there-a-dumps-write-or-encode-function\"></a>\n\n[Tomli-W](https://github.com/hukkin/tomli-w) is the write-only counterpart of Tomli, providing `dump` and `dumps` functions.\n\nThe core library does not include write capability, as most TOML use cases are read-only, and Tomli intends to be minimal.\n\n### How do TOML types map into Python types?<a

For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\n`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as\nmypy and pyright. Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\n\n`typing_extensions` uses\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions ~=x.y`,\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\n[This](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#compatible-release)\nis equivalent to `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`. Do not depend on `~= x.y.z`\nunless you really know what you're doing; that defeats the purpose of\nsemantic versioning.\n\n## Included items\n\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\ncomplete listing of module contents.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\n\n"
