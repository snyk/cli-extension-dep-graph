Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (e.g. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can.\n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair Unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess (aka. defining noise in rendered text).\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## [3.4.4](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/3.4.2...3.4.4) (2025-10-13)\n\n### Changed\n- Bound `setuptools` to a specific constraint `setuptools>=68,<=81`.\n- Raised upper bound of mypyc for the optional pre-built extension to v1.18.2\n\n### Removed\n- `setuptools-scm` as a build dependency.\n\n### Misc\n- Enforced hashes in `dev-requirements.txt` and created `ci-requirements.txt` for security purposes.\n- Additional pre-built wheels for riscv64, s390x, and armv7l architectures.\n- Restore ` multiple.intoto.jsonl` in GitHub releases in addition to individual attestation file per wheel.\n\n## [3.4.3](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/3.4.2...3.4.3) (2025-08-09)\n\n### Changed\n- mypy(c) is no longer a required dependency at build time if `CHARSET_NORMALIZER_USE_MYPYC` isn't set to `1`. (#595) (#583)\n- automatically lower confidence on small bytes samples that are not Unicode in `detect` output legacy function. (#391)\n\n### Added\n- Custom build backend to overcome inability to mark mypy as an optional dependency in the build phase.\n- Support for Python 3.14\n\n### Fixed\n- sdist archive contained useless directories.\n- automatically fallback on valid UTF-16 or UTF-32 even if the md says it's noisy. (#633)\n\n### Misc\n- SBOM are automatically published to the relevant GitHub release to comply with regulatory changes.\n  Each published wheel comes with its SBOM.

        "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for `Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_\nand `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThe latest versions of these standards supplied here provide\nmore comprehensive language coverage and reduce the potential of\nallowing domains with known security vulnerabilities. This library\nis a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports an older superseded IDNA specification from 2003.\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI via the\ntypical mechanisms, such as:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to ASCII compatible encoding\n(known as A-labels), or to Unicode strings (known as U-labels)\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis library provides support for `Unicode IDNA Compatibility\nProcessing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_ which normalizes input from\ndifferent potential ways a user may input a domain prior to performing the IDNA\nconversion operations. This functionality, known as a \n`mapping <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, is considered by the\nspecification to be a local user-interface issue distinct from IDNA\nconversion functionality.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its position in the string (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards using the command-line\nscript ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.8 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Support for older versions are likely to be removed from new releases\n  as automated tests can no longer easily be run, i.e. once the Python\n  version is officially end-of-life.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n* **Transitional processing**. Unicode 16.0.0 removed transitional\n  processing so the `transitional` argument for the encode() method\n  no longer has any effect and will be removed at a later date.\n\n"

        "description": "JMESPath\n========\n\n\n.. image:: https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg\n   :target: https://gitter.im/jmespath/chat\n\n\nJMESPath (pronounced \"james path\") allows you to declaratively specify how to\nextract elements from a JSON document.\n\nFor example, given this document::\n\n    {\"foo\": {\"bar\": \"baz\"}}\n\nThe jmespath expression ``foo.bar`` will return \"baz\".\n\nJMESPath also supports:\n\nReferencing elements in a list.  Given the data::\n\n    {\"foo\": {\"bar\": [\"one\", \"two\"]}}\n\nThe expression: ``foo.bar[0]`` will return \"one\".\nYou can also reference all the items in a list using the ``*``\nsyntax::\n\n   {\"foo\": {\"bar\": [{\"name\": \"one\"}, {\"name\": \"two\"}]}}\n\nThe expression: ``foo.bar[*].name`` will return [\"one\", \"two\"].\nNegative indexing is also supported (-1 refers to the last element\nin the list).  Given the data above, the expression\n``foo.bar[-1].name`` will return \"two\".\n\nThe ``*`` can also be used for hash types::\n\n   {\"foo\": {\"bar\": {\"name\": \"one\"}, \"baz\": {\"name\": \"two\"}}}\n\nThe expression: ``foo.*.name`` will return [\"one\", \"two\"].\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install JMESPath from pypi with:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install jmespath\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nThe ``jmespath.py`` library has two functions\nthat operate on python data structures.  You can use ``search``\nand give it the jmespath expression and the data:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> import jmespath\n    >>> path = jmespath.search('foo.bar', {'foo': {'bar': 'baz'}})\n    'baz'\n\nSimilar to the ``re`` module, you can use the ``compile`` function\nto compile the JMESPath expression and use this parsed expression\nto perform repeated searches:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> import jmespath\n    >>> expression = jmespath.compile('foo.bar')\n    >>> expression.search({'foo': {'bar': 'baz'}})\n    'baz'\n    >>> expression.search({'foo': {'bar': 'other'}})\n    'other'\n\nThis is useful if you're going to use the same jmespath expression to\nsearch multiple documents.  This avoids having to reparse the\nJMESPath expression each time you search a new document.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nYou can provide an instance of ``jmespath.Options`` to control how\na JMESPath expression is evaluated.  The most common scenario for\nusing an ``Options`` instance is if you want to have ordered output\nof your dict keys.  To do this you can use either of these options:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> import jmespath\n    >>> jmespath.search('{a: a, b: b}',\n    ...                 mydata,\n    ...                 jmespath.Options(dict_cls=collections.OrderedDict))\n\n\n    >>> import jmespath\n    >>> parsed = jmespath.compile('{a: a, b: b}')\n    >>> parsed.search(mydata,\n    ...               jmespath.Options(dict_cls=collections.OrderedDict))\n\n\nCustom Functions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe JMESPath language has numerous\n`built-in functions\n<http://jmespath.org/specification.html#built-in-functions>`__, but it is\nalso possible to add your own custom functions.  Keep in mind that\ncustom function support in jmespath.py is experimental and the API may\nchange based on feedback.\n\n**If you have a custom function that you've found useful, consider submitting\nit to jmespath.site and propose that it be added to the JMESPath language.**\nYou can submit proposals\n`here <https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.site/issues>`__.\n\nTo create custom functions:\n\n* Create a subclass of ``jmespath.functions.Functions``.\n* Create a method with the name ``_func_<your function name>``.\n* Apply the ``jmespath.functions.signature`` decorator that indicates\n  the expected types of the function arguments.\n* Provide an instance of your subclass in a ``jmespath.Options`` object.\n\nBelow are a few examples:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import jmespath\n    from jmespath import functions\n\n    # 1. Create a subclass of functions.Functions.\n    #    The function.Functions base class has logic\n    #    that introspects all of its methods and automatically\n    #    registers your custom functions in its function table.\n    class CustomFunctions(functions.Functions):\n\n        # 2 and 3.  Create a function that starts with _func_\n        # and decorate it with @signature which indicates its\n        # expected types.\n        # In this example, we're creating a jmespath function\n        # called \"unique_letters\" that accepts a single argument\n        # with an expected type \"string\".\n        @functions.signature({'types': ['string']})\n        def _func_unique_letters(self, s):\n            # Given a string s, return a sorted\n            # string of unique letters: 'ccbbadd' ->  'abcd'\n            return ''.join(sorted(set(s)))\n\n        # Here's another example.  This is creating\n        # a jmespath function called \"my_add\" that expects\n        # two arguments, both of which should be of type number.\n        @functions.signature({'types': ['number']}, {'types': ['number']})\n        def _func_my_add(self, x, y):\n            return x + y\n\n    # 4. Provide an instance of your subclass in a Options object.\n    options = jmespath.Options(custom_functions=CustomFunctions())\n\n    # Provide this value to jmespath.search:\n    # This will print 3\n    print(\n        jmespath.search(\n            'my_add(`1`, `2`)', {}, options=options)\n    )\n\n    # This will print \"abcd\"\n    print(\n        jmespath.search(\n            'foo.bar | unique_letters(@)',\n            {'foo': {'bar': 'ccbbadd'}},\n            options=options)\n    )\n\nAgain, if you come up with useful functions that you think make\nsense in the JMESPath language (and make sense to implement in all\nJMESPath libraries, not just python), please let us know at\n`jmespath.site <https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.site/issues>`__.\n\n\nSpecification\n=============\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the JMESPath language, you can check out\nthe `JMESPath tutorial <http://jmespath.org/tutorial.html>`__.  Also check\nout the `JMESPath examples page <http://jmespath.org/examples.html>`__ for\nexamples of more complex jmespath queries.\n\nThe grammar is specified using ABNF, as described in\n`RFC4234 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4234.txt>`_.\nYou can find the most up to date\n`grammar for JMESPath here <http://jmespath.org/specification.html#grammar>`__.\n\nYou can read the full\n`JMESPath specification here <http://jmespath.org/specification.html>`__.\n\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nIn addition to the unit tests for the jmespath modules,\nthere is a ``tests/compliance`` directory that contains\n.json files with test cases.  This allows other implementations\nto verify they are producing the correct output.  Each json\nfile is grouped by feature.\n\n\nDiscuss\n=======\n\nJoin us on our `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/jmespath/chat>`__\nif you want to chat or if you have any questions.\n\n\n"

Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes). For more information about how to contribute to the project, see the ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file in the repository.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nThe dateutil module was written by Gustavo Niemeyer <gustavo@niemeyer.net>\nin 2003.\n\nIt is maintained by:\n\n* Gustavo Niemeyer <gustavo@niemeyer.net> 2003-2011\n* Tomi Pieviläinen <tomi.pievilainen@iki.fi> 2012-2014\n* Yaron de Leeuw <me@jarondl.net> 2014-2016\n* Paul Ganssle <paul@ganssle.io> 2015-\n\nStarting with version 2.4.1 and running until 2.8.2, all source and binary\ndistributions will be signed by a PGP key that has, at the very least, been\nsigned by the key which made the previous release.

Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n```python3\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")\n>>> resp.status\n200\n>>> resp.data\nb\"User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install urllib3\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n$ cd urllib3\n$ pip install .\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io).\n\n\n## Community\n\nurllib3 has a [community Discord channel](https://discord.gg/urllib3) for asking questions and\ncollaborating with other contributors. Drop by and say hello 👋\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n\n## Security Disclosures\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with maintainers.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) (Seth M. Larson)\n- [@pquentin](https://github.com/pquentin) (Quentin Pradet)\n- [@theacodes](https://github.com/theacodes) (Thea Flowers)\n- [@haikuginger](https://github.com/haikuginger) (Jess Shapiro)\n- [@lukasa](https://github.com/lukasa) (Cory Benfield)\n- [@sigmavirus24](https://github.com/sigmavirus24) (Ian Stapleton Cordasco)\n- [@shazow](https://github.com/shazow) (Andrey Petrov)\n\n👋\n\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nIf your company benefits from this library, please consider [sponsoring its\ndevelopment](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sponsors.html).\n\n\n## For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for urllib3 is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].  Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for\npurchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances\nfrom the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\ntools.\n\n[1]: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-urllib3?utm_source=pypi-urllib3&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\n"
